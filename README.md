## Objective
Your bot can ask anything you want, but there are two rules for your output:

1. The line with the test should end with the question mark character;<br>
2. an option starts with a digit followed by the dot (1., 2., 3., 4.)<br>
3. If a user enters an incorrect answer, the bot may print a message:

Please, try again.<br>
The program should stop on the correct answer and print:<br>
Congratulations, have a nice day! <br> at the end.

## Example
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

### Example 1: a dialogue with the final version of your bot

Hello! My name is Aid.<br>
I was created in 2020.<br>
Please, remind me your name.<br>
> Max<br>
What a great name you have, Max!<br>
Let me guess your age.<br>
Enter remainders of dividing your age by 3, 5 and 7.<br>
> 1 <br>
> 2<br>
> 1<br>
Your age is 22: that's a good time to start programming!<br>
Now I will prove to you that I can count to any number you want.<br>

Let's test your programming knowledge.<br>
Why do we use methods?<br>
1. To repeat a statement multiple times.<br>
2. To decompose a program into several small subroutines.<br>
3. To determine the execution time of a program.<br>
4. To interrupt the execution of a program.<br>

Completed, have a nice day!<br>
Congratulations, have a nice day!<br>
The program must end with the Congratulations, have a nice day! message.
